**Gender and Age Distribution Analysis**

_Overview_

This R script analyzes a dataset containing information about gender and age in a population. It performs data cleaning, standardizes gender labels, and then visualizes the distribution of genders and ages through a bar chart and histogram, respectively.

_Dataset_

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the "gender.csv" file. Ensure that the file is correctly formatted and located in the same directory as the R script.

_Prerequisites_

Make sure you have the following installed before running the script:

->R (https://www.r-project.org/)

->RStudio (optional but recommended) (https://www.rstudio.com/)


_Setup_

->Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

->Open the R script in an R environment (e.g., RStudio).

->Ensure that the "gender.csv" file is in the same directory as the R script.

->Run the script to generate visualizations.

_Usage_

The script reads the "gender.csv" file, cleans and standardizes the 'Gender' column, and then creates a bar chart for gender distribution and a histogram for age distribution.

_Output_

The script generates visualizations illustrating the distribution of genders and ages in the population.

_Gender Distribution_

->Bar chart with two colors ('pink' and 'blue') representing different genders.

->X-axis: Gender

->Y-axis: Count

->Title: Distribution of Genders in the Population


_Age Distribution_

->Histogram with green bars and a black border.

->X-axis: Age

->Y-axis: Count

->Title: Distribution of Ages in the Population

_Notes_

->Ensure that the dataset is correctly formatted and accessible.

->Customize visual elements or chart settings based on specific requirements.
