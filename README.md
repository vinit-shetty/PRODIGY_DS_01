This R script conducts a comprehensive analysis of a population dataset, focusing on gender and age distribution. It begins by cleaning and standardizing gender labels from the "gender.csv" file. The subsequent visualizations include a bar chart showcasing gender distribution with distinctive 'pink' and 'blue' colors, and a histogram illustrating age distribution with green bars and a black border. To utilize this script, ensure R and RStudio are installed, and the dataset is correctly formatted and located in the same directory as the script. The user can customize visual elements based on specific requirements for a nuanced exploration of population demographics.
